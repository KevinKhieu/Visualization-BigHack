  "summary": "I am a Masters candidate in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. My research work focuses on wide bandgap semiconductors (AlN, GaN, SiC) for extreme harsh environments like high temperatures (> 600C), radiation and chemical attack, such as in outer space. I'm currently exploring high temperature stable ohmic and Schottky contacts to AlGaN/GaN HEMTs and InAlN/GaN HEMTs for extended periods of operation in air. In the past, I have explored microgravity effects on defect kinetics and material properties in 4H-SiC (Silicon Carbide). This work involved electrical, thermal and microstructural analysis and extensive use of fabrication and characterization facilities at the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility (SNF) and Stanford Nano Shared Facilities (SNSF) improvements.Prior to Stanford, I worked as a design engineer at Texas Instruments (India) for two years. My work at TI touched some of the most intriguing aspects of low-power mixed-signal circuit design, through which I have come to appreciate the complexity in architecting a system that has created a niche in the ultra-low power family of mixed signal processors.In 2012, I graduated from NIT Trichy, India, with the highest honors in Electrical and Electronics Engineering (President Gold Medal).",
