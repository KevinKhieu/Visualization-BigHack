  "summary": "www.gracesnoh.comHi there! My name is Grace and I like to solve problems through design. Something I love about design is the process, starting from napkin sketches to delivering the final product. What I realized from my past design experiences is that reflecting back on the process and where you went wrong or right is where you can make the most strides in improvement. I strive to apply this principle not only in my designs, but also to every other aspect of my life. If you have any inquires or projects that you'd like to collaborate with me on, feel free to reach me at gracesnoh@gmail.com",
