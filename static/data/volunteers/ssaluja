I am driven not by merely doing but by experiencing new things and sharing that experience with others.I am passionate about innovative design, building prototypes, hacking systems and leading change.When I am not brainstorming ideas and solutions with my friends, you can find me on the squash court, playing for the Cal’s Mens squash team. Through high school I have experienced Independent research which I published & presented in the form of a paper at International Conference. Today, I work to make a tangible difference in the world through my knowledge. Always excited to learn new things and meet new people.",
